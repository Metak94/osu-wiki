## Mappools

## Ruleset

### Tournament Rules

1. This version of the OCM is a team tournament, played on the osu!catch game mode. 
2. This competition is a 2 versus 2 setup. The team size can be up to 4 members, with a minimum of 3 members per team.
3. Score V2 will be used.
4. The tournament is open to any player with a rank of at least #4000. There's no restriction of country or region.
5. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a map is considered as passing it.
6. If the beatmap ends in a draw, there will be a rematch on the same map.
7. If a player disconnects, they will be treated as if they failed the map.
   - The map can be replayed if the disconect was about 30 seconds after the map begins. This is up to the referee's discretion.
8. Teams have 10 minutes from the scheduled time to present at least 2 members. If a team cannot present 2 players after this time, the match will be declared a loss by default. 
9. Map selectors and tournament organizers are NOT allowed to play, while referees and streamers can do so without problems.
10. We hope there is a good atmosphere between all teams, any team or player who is toxic or disrespectful to any staff member (or any team) will be immediately disqualified from the tournament.
11. **Reschedules will only be considered if both teams agree to a time, this needs to be done and notified to the tournament staff before Wednesday at 23:59 UTC+0 in that particular week when your match takes place.**
12. **Reschedules may only be requested by a team captain.**
   - **Please do not ask for a reschedule unless it is absolutely needed. The tournament staff has the right to decline the request.**

### Mappool Instructions

1. There will be 1 mappool for the Group Stage, 1 mappool for the Quarterfinals, 1 mappool for the Semifinals and 1 mappool for the Finals and Grand Finals.
2. The tournament mappool will feature: 3 Nomod, 3 HR, 3 DT, 3 HD, 2 FL, 2 DTB and the TieBreaker, for a total of 17 maps.
3. In the maps HR,DT and DTB maps, players may also use HD if desired.
4. DTB is to be played with NF. The lowest combined score wins.
5. Mappools for Finals and Grand Finals consists of 19 maps in total. 2 Freemod will be added.
6. For Freemod maps, one player must use HR (with HD if desired). The other player must play with no mods or HD.

### Match Instructions

1. Each team is free to select up to one warm-up map.
2. Each captain has to roll a number. Both teams can ban one beatmap to be selected from the pool starting from the loser of the roll. These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match.
3. The winner of the roll has the first pick.
4. Beatmap selection will alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the map pool.
5. **After a team reaches 3 points the opposition can ban again, like a comeback mechanic.**
6. On this second ban, the team can choose between ban another map or a player:
   - Ban a player means that **one member of the enemy team can't play the next one map.**
7. If a team with only 2 members present has a player banned by the opposing team, **the next map is lost by default.**
8. In case of a tie, the tiebreaker map must be played.
